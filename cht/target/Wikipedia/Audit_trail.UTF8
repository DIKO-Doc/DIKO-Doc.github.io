 '''稽核軌跡'''（也稱為'''檔案日誌'''）是與安全相關的時間順序記錄、記錄集和/或目的地和記錄來源，它們提供了在任何時候影響特定操作，程序的活動順序的文件證據或事件<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf |title=National Information Assurance (IA) Glossary |trans-title=國家信息保障（IA）詞彙表 |publisher=[[Committee on National Security Systems]] |pages=4 |date=1996-08-07 |access-date=2012-03-07 |format=PDF |language=en }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=5572 |title=ATIS Telecom Glossary 2012 - audit trail |trans-title=ATIS電信詞彙表2012 - 審計線索 |publisher=[[Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions]] (ATIS) Committee PRQC |year=2012 |access-date=2012-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313232104/http://www.atis.org/glossary/definition.aspx?id=5572 |archivedate=2013-03-13 |language=en }}</ref>。稽核軌跡通常來自一些活動，例如：[[金融交易]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-86.htm |title=SEC Proposes Consolidated Audit Trail System to Better Track Market Trades |publisher=U.S. [[美國證券交易委員會|Securities and Exchange Commission]] |date=2010-05-26 |access-date=2012-03-07 |language=en }}</ref>、[[科學方法|科學研究]]和醫療保健數據交易<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=5ff3a0efed913ef8fae9e225869688a2&rgn=div5&view=text&node=21:1.0.1.1.7&idno=21 |title=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations - Title 21: Food and Drugs - Part 11: Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures |publisher=[[美國政府出版局|U.S. Government Printing Office]] |access-date=2012-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608090316/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=3094bb76639c37239557767756fd7878&rgn=div5&view=text&node=21%3A1.0.1.1.7&idno=21 |archivedate=2010-06-08 |language=en }}</ref>，或個人、系統、帳號以及其他實體的[[通信]]等活動。

The process that creates an audit trail is typically required to always run in a [[privileged mode]], so it can access and supervise all actions from all users; a normal user should not be allowed to stop/change it. Furthermore, for the same reason, trail file or [[Table (database)|database table]] with a trail should not be accessible to normal users. Another way of handling this issue is through the use of a role-based security model in the software.<ref>{{cite book |title=Insider computer fraud: an in-depth framework for detecting and defending against insider IT attacks |author=Brancik, Kenneth C. |chapter=Chapter 2: Related Research in Insider Computer Fraud and Information Security Controls |year=2007 |pages=18–19 |publisher=CRC Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsDngU-RUywC |isbn=1-4200-4659-4}}</ref> The software can operate with the closed-looped controls, or as a '[[closed system]]', as required by many companies when using audit trail functionality.
